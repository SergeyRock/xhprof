This fork of original Xhprof adds new features with new GUI.
It allows to:
1. Compare more then two profile runs at the same time without permission about the same namespace (against two runs only in one namesapace in native xhprof gui tool)
2. Set custom comments on runs
3. Delete chosen runs from gui

Temp php directory is used as source for xhprof runs by default.

For installation and usage notes refer to:
   xhprof_html/docs/index.html
